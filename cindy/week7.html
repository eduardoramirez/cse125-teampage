pops up that needs to be done. Like bug fixes. Fix lighting issues.</p><h6 class="subtitles">Goals Accomplished</h6><p>- Classes have been refactored. Movements are now relative to camera.
Created a stage with an awesome billboard.</p><h6 class="subtitles">Reasons for Unaccomplished Goals</h6><p>-Did not receive list of hats to make until later. At that point, I was 
busy trying to figure out why some objects in the stage I made did not 
have physics when I loaded it to the game. Still needs to fix that. 
Lighting has not been fixed yet. Too much shader code to read through and 
need to review my geometry.</p><h6 class="subtitles">Goals for Next Week </h6><p>- Fix lighting with Tim. Research and implement UI for the game. Fix the
physics issue with the stage.</p><h6 class="subtitles">Morale</h6><p>- Made stage in 5 hours after not touching Maya in forever. Much faster 
than expected. Glad I am not totally horrible now. The todo list on 
Trello is shrinking, thank goodness, so now I can breathe! :D</p><img src="https://45.media.tumblr.com/18cdb1bd156307a5e1a9eb42134e6ec3/tumblr_ntilg9nw861tq2im0o1_r1_500.gif" class="img-rounded"><br></div><script src="../dist/js/vendor/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="../dist/js/flat-ui.min.js"></script></body></html>
