Create pretty shaders. Figure out volumetric clouds with 
Tim. Add text rendering to overlay game screen. Fine tune graphics related 
things so that we donâ€™t embarrass ourselves at the demo.</p><h6 class="subtitles">Goals Accomplished</h6><p>- Lighting is fixed, as in we get rid of complicated lighting so it looked
more cartoony like our game. Clouds are there (Thank you Tim). Text does

icons to represent lives. </p><h6 class="subtitles">Reasons for Unaccomplished Goals</h6><p>- Had no time to look into pretty shaders.
