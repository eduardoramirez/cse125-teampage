whether it is a shader issue or something else. Set up a basic world (i.e. skybox and floor).</p><h6 class="subtitles">Goals Accomplished</h6><p>- Have a floor set up and halfway done setting up skybox. Got the texture 
loading stuff done. But need to test it once the rest of the code is written.</p><h6 class="subtitles">Reasons for Unaccomplished Goals</h6><p>- Was completely out most of the week because of my cold, which the doctor

drinking lots of fluids and sleeping.</p><h6 class="subtitles">Goals for Next Week </h6><p>- Finish all my goals from last week, work more with the server people on 
server integration and whatever needs to be done on the graphic sides that pops up.</p><h6 class="subtitles">Morale</h6><p>-The stabbing pain in my throat is gone but still have a hoarse voice and 
minor cough. Besides that I am pretty healthy again I guess. So this makes
my morale a bit better. But feeling behind because I was out all week. So
