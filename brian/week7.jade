  h6(class='subtitles') Goals for Next Week 
  p
    | - Since the item logic is done, I am focusing on customizing gravity. 
    | Currently, gravity is applied to the whole world, so all the objects in 
    | the game are affected by the same gravitational force, but we want to 
    | allow different gravity force for different objects in the game
    | (i.e. allowing one player to float with a specific hat). I will first 
    | practice messing with gravity on the items, so by next week, I should 
    | have certain item boxes falling at the normal rate, some floating in the 
    | air, and some moving sideways.
