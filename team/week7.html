A lot of work was done and integration went 
much more smoothly this time. On the game side, we integrated shooting, 
item equipping, de-equipping, dynamic movement, proper jumping, and 
camera based movement in the game. Our code can actually be described 
as a video game of some sorts and we have a MVP. Next we’re going to 
work on more hat interactions, integrating a sound engine, combat
mechanics, and getting the wrecking ball in the level swinging. We 
discussed more hats and what they’re supposed to do and we have good
general idea on how to proceed for next week.</p><img src="../img/img_week7_1.png" class="center-block img-rounded"><p class="img-comment">

physics to it. We also worked on hat attachment on the client side. For
next week, we plan to have UI text overlays to show how many lives the
player has and what hat they have equipped on, as well as fixing some
bugs with the lighting and the lack of bullet rigid body on some of the
stage objects.</p><br><div class="myVideo center-block"><video height="150" preload="auto" poster="" data-setup="{}" class="myVideo video-js"><source src="../img/vid_week7_1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><p class="img-comment"> 
Here’s a video of our progress followed by pictures of the level design</p></div><br><p>In terms of art, our original animation did not load properly and we
could not find a solution to fix it, so we are remaking the model. The
original model also had few polygons so the animation looked strange.
Hopefully this time around everything will look and work better. Also
going to have more hat designs and animation hopefully..  </p><img src="../img/img_week7_3.png" class="center-block img-rounded"><p class="img-comment">
