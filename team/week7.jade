  h3(class='titles') Week 7
  p
    | Pretty decent week for us. A lot of work was done and integration went 
    | much more smoothly this time. On the game side, we integrated shooting, 
    | item equipping, de-equipping, dynamic movement, proper jumping, and 
    | camera based movement in the game. Our code can actually be described 
    | as a video game of some sorts and we have a MVP. Next we’re going to 
    | work on more hat interactions, integrating a sound engine, combat
    | mechanics, and getting the wrecking ball in the level swinging. We 
    | discussed more hats and what they’re supposed to do and we have good
    | general idea on how to proceed for next week.

    | On the Graphics side, we created the stage in Maya and applied bullet 
    | physics to it. We also worked on hat attachment on the client side. For
    | next week, we plan to have UI text overlays to show how many lives the
    | player has and what hat they have equipped on, as well as fixing some
    | bugs with the lighting and the lack of bullet rigid body on some of the
    | stage objects.

    | In terms of art, our original animation did not load properly and we
    | could not find a solution to fix it, so we are remaking the model. The
    | original model also had few polygons so the animation looked strange.
    | Hopefully this time around everything will look and work better. Also
    | going to have more hat designs and animation hopefully..
