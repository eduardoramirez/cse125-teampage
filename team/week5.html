We got proper camera and skybox setup 
working within the engine, giving us a better environment to experiment
with game physics and logic in.</p><p>We integrated Tiffany’s skeleton models within the game as player models, 
and added the ability to shoot mangos for each player. We’re still working
on shooting orientation, but the shooting mechanics should become more 
precise once we have dynamic controller interfaces for players set up 
(also making players more player like).</p><br><div class="myVideo center-block"><video height="150" preload="auto" poster="" data-setup="{}" class="myVideo video-js"><source src="../img/vid_week5_1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><p class="img-comment"> 
Shooting mechanism at work.</p></div><br><p>We also have been working on item spawning logic and items (hats) can now 
spawn randomly at any chosen intervals.</p><br><div class="myVideo center-block"><video height="150" preload="auto" poster="" data-setup="{}" class="myVideo video-js"><source src="../img/vid_week5_2.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><p class="img-comment"> 
Item drops at work.</p></div><br><p>Our model that Tiffany drew can also now be loaded by ASSIMP. Seemed like
we needed to just export the model as one mesh.  Now, the next thing for
animation is to get the skeleton to show properly and animate it. 
Currently able to load the bones in and will continue to work on it to
display properly.</p><br><img src="../img/img_week5_1.png" class="center-block img-rounded"><p class="img-comment">
