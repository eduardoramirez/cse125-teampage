obligations. We added gamepad integration within our game and made the 
game playable with a gamepad.</p><br><p>On the Physics side, we were able to load a compound shaped object using the
Mango object model, creating a Mango shaped physical body using Maya. 
Here’s a video showing the new Mango physics in action-</p><div class="myVideo center-block"><video height="150" preload="auto" poster="" data-setup="{}" class="myVideo video-js"><source src="../img/vid_week4_1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><p class="img-comment"> 
The new Mango rigid bodies allow the Mangos to roll around like real mangos</p></div><p>On the Graphics side we were able to start getting the animation setup. 
After doing some research, we decided to use FBX since it’s more widely 
used and ASSIMP supports it.  We were able to so far successfully load 
external FBX files into our game.</p><br><p>In terms of art, we now have a basic 3D model of our character with a 
skeleton. However the skeleton has not yet been rigged and bound to the model.</p><br></div><script src="https://vjs.zencdn.net/4.7/video.js"></script><script src="../dist/js/vendor/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="../dist/js/flat-ui.min.js"></script></body></html>
