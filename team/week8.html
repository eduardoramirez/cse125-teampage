We have a Main Menu and 
Character Selection screen now. Added 5 different hats in total on the
graphics side though hat game logic is only up for a couple hats. Hats 
are now loaded directly as items instead of crates (though maybe crates
are better as a surprise?).</p><p>Most importantly, we finally have our character animation working. 
Tiffany has been really excited to work on the more fun animating portion
now. We’ve added a couple animations (running and punching), though we
plan to add a few more (jumping, stunned, propeller hat spinning, maybe 
a taunt).</p><p>Our code went through a bit of refactoring and we’ve moved to building 
our code in release mode now that we have animations and almost bug free gameplay.</p><p>Character movement was switched back to using forces (while preserving 
the orientation of the models). The Physics simulation was sped up so the
gameplay feels much more natural now (though we plan on refining it more).</p><p>We plan on adding more brawler elements to our game to make it more
exciting. Hat abilities would be controlled by 2 buttons now, planning to 
add other items that turnoff/lower gravity for a bit, release a shockwave, etc.</p><p>Was originally planning to have sound this week but pushing that to next week for now.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz5jUcFPwLI">Here’s a video of our progress</a></p><br></div><script src="https://vjs.zencdn.net/4.7/video.js"></script><script src="../dist/js/vendor/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="../dist/js/flat-ui.min.js"></script></body></html>
