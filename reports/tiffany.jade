    h6(class='subtitles') Concrete Goals
    p
      | - Model and texture mango
      br
      | - Concept art
      
    h6(class='subtitles') Goals Accomplished
    p
      | - Modeled the mango
      br
      | - Added some textures (UV mapping/painting in progress)
      br
      | - Some concept art
      
    h6(class='subtitles') Reasons for Unaccomplished Goals
    p
      | - Learning how to use Maya and apply textures to models is taking 
      | some time. I am also focusing on that more than concept art because I
      | would like to match my concepts to what I am capable of modeling in
      | order to not be too ambitious.

    h6(class='subtitles') Goals for Next Week 
    p
      | - Finish the mango
      br
      | - More concept art
      br
      | - Model basic character with joints
      br
      | - Possibly start on modeling hats and/or stage?
    
    h6(class='subtitles') Morale
    p
      | - Hungry but pretty excited to model some more!
