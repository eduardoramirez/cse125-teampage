    h2 Cindy's reports
    h3(class='titles') Week 3
    h6(class='subtitles') Concrete Goals
    p
      | - Setup camera, setup scene graph
      
    h6(class='subtitles') Goals Accomplished
    p
      | - Setup camera, setup scene graph. Other things popped up as well. 
      | Fixed model loader to be texture agnostic. Added hashtable to store models but was later scrapped. Oh wells.
      
    h6(class='subtitles') Reasons for Unaccomplished Goals
    p
      | - N/A

    h6(class='subtitles') Goals for Next Week 
    p
      | - Figure out the reason the light position seems to be fixed to the 
      | model, whether it is a shader issue or something else. Set up a basic 
      | world (i.e. skybox and floor).
    
    h6(class='subtitles') Morale
    p
      | - Lot of stuff got done so thatâ€™s good. But got sick the day after 
      | getting attacked by tiny kids with water guns, water balloons, and 
      | pointy toy dinosaurs. So morale at the moment is meh. But a meh 
      | leaning towards good.

    h3(class='titles') Week 2
    h6(class='subtitles') Concrete Goals
    p
      | - Setup the basic framework with OpenGL 4.0, as in shaders, lighting, camera, etc.
      
    h6(class='subtitles') Goals Accomplished
    p
      | - OpenGL and now load obj files, shaders and display models
      
    h6(class='subtitles') Reasons for Unaccomplished Goals
    p
      | - There was a lot of issues in setting up OpenGL because it is hard to 
      | debug OpenGL when generating buffers and drawing. There was also an 
      | issue with parsing models and loading in the data to the buffers.

    h6(class='subtitles') Goals for Next Week 
    p
      | - Finish the framework, add camera and light classes.
    
    h6(class='subtitles') Morale
    p
      | - Slightly sad on how long it took to set up the VAO/VBO stuff (Shout out 
      | to teammate Tim for the help though). But trying to be optimistic about 
      | the next week. Naturally a pessimist so trying to be optimistic is the best I can do.
