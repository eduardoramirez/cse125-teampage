Other things popped up as well. 
Fixed model loader to be texture agnostic. Added hashtable to store models but was later scrapped. Oh wells.</p><h6 class="subtitles">Reasons for Unaccomplished Goals</h6><p>- N/A</p><h6 class="subtitles">Goals for Next Week </h6><p>- Figure out the reason the light position seems to be fixed to the 
model, whether it is a shader issue or something else. Set up a basic 
world (i.e. skybox and floor).</p><h6 class="subtitles">Morale</h6><p>- Lot of stuff got done so thatâ€™s good. But got sick the day after 
getting attacked by tiny kids with water guns, water balloons, and 
pointy toy dinosaurs. So morale at the moment is meh. But a meh 
leaning towards good.</p><img src="https://kidfromthe6ix.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/im-sick.gif" class="img-rounded"><br><h3 class="titles">Week 2</h3><h6 class="subtitles">Concrete Goals</h6><p>- Setup the basic framework with OpenGL 4.0, as in shaders, lighting, camera, etc.</p><h6 class="subtitles">Goals Accomplished</h6><p>- OpenGL and now load obj files, shaders and display models</p><h6 class="subtitles">Reasons for Unaccomplished Goals</h6><p>- There was a lot of issues in setting up OpenGL because it is hard to 
debug OpenGL when generating buffers and drawing. There was also an 
issue with parsing models and loading in the data to the buffers.</p><h6 class="subtitles">Goals for Next Week </h6><p>- Finish the framework, add camera and light classes.</p><h6 class="subtitles">Morale</h6><p>- Slightly sad on how long it took to set up the VAO/VBO stuff (Shout out 
to teammate Tim for the help though). But trying to be optimistic about 
the next week. Naturally a pessimist so trying to be optimistic is the best I can do.</p><img src="http://mashable.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Supernatural-Dean.gif" class="img-rounded"><br></div><script src="../dist/js/vendor/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="../dist/js/flat-ui.min.js"></script></body></html>
