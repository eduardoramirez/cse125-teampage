    h6(class='subtitles') Concrete Goals
    p
      | - Add serialization/deserialization of data over the network.
      br
      | - Come up with a schema for messages.
      br
      | - Make Server the source of truth.
      br
      | - Add Physics to the game.
      
    h6(class='subtitles') Goals Accomplished
    p
      | - Integrated Google Protocol Buffers to handle serialization of data.
      br
      | - Created a basic protobuf schema for game events being sent from client to network and vice versa.
      br
      | - Restructured Server side code and created a Game Handling loop.
      br
      | - Integrated Bullet Physics with the game engine, and moved game logic to the server.
      br
      | - Merge(Graphics, Networking)

    h6(class='subtitles') Goals for Next Week 
    p
      | Not sure yet. Here are things I have in mind-
      | - Work on Game Logic. Put Physics to good use.
      | - Add more game elements, items, bullets, etc.
      | - Integrate game controllers with the game.

    p
      | - Learn Bullet Physics and integrate Physics with existing code.
      br
      | - Start working on Game logic.
      br
      | - Look more into serialization/deserialization
