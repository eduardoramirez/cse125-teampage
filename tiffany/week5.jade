  h6(class='subtitles') Reasons for Unaccomplished Goals
  p
    | - The most important goal was to finish the skeleton rig, but I kind of 
    | wish it didnâ€™t take me as long as it did. A good portion of the time went 
    | to testing out different tutorials before I finally set on using the 
    | premade HumanIK skeleton, which was a lot more convenient to work with!
