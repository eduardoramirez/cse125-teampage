  h6(class='subtitles') Reasons for Unaccomplished Goals
  p
    | - The graphics team offered to help with hats, so instead of making more 
    | hats, I gave them a list of possible hats and we all decided on 
    | which ones to use.

  h6(class='subtitles') Goals for Next Week 
  p
    | - Create the hats we decided on and maybe also the props that come with
    | the hats (ie a wand to go with the wizard hat)
    br
    | - Possibly polish/add animations to character

  h6(class='subtitles') Morale
  p
    | - Much better than before
