  h6(class='subtitles') Concrete Goals
  p
    | - Finish the improved model
    br

  h6(class='subtitles') Goals Accomplished
  p
    | - Added animations to the model!
    
  h6(class='subtitles') Reasons for Unaccomplished Goals
  p
    | - After rigging and animating the new model, it still refused to load
    | properly to Open 3D Model Viewer. So I decided to try it out on Unity to
    | see if it worked (since I conveniently have Unity on my laptop), and it
    | did! Later Cindy redid the rigging from scratch, and we learned that
    | perhaps there is something with Maya’s HumanIK function that Assimp 
    | doesn’t like, making the model appear collapsed when animated. So with
    | Cindy’s rigged version of my model I was able to create animations! 
    br
    | - Unfortunately I wasn’t able to make any hats because I was away for the
    | weekend for VIS 149, but Cindy also helped with that.

  h6(class='subtitles') Goals for Next Week 
  p
    | - Most important: Skin the model
    br
    | - Add more animations as necessary

  h6(class='subtitles') Morale
  p
    | - In high spirits!
